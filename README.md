```

## Usage

Finally, you can run the website using:
```shell

### Adding a language

- Add its digram to the list of supported languages in `_config.yml` called `languages`.
- Copy the `en` folder and rename it to your new language digram
- Edit the `index.html` in it, to modify the digram of the target layout
- Copy `_layouts/front-en.html` and rename it by replacing the digram.
- Edit the file `lang` attribute
- Finally, write all the translations at the bottom of `_config.yml` by adding a new entry to `t` (don't change any key name!)

Congrats, you've added a new language!
